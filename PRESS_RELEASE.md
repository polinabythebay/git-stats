## Gitstats

Lets developers visualize their public Github repos by language.

### Summary

Github only displays statistics that help other people understand how useful your profile is to them: what is shown by default is the projects with the most stars, and the projects you’ve recently pushed to. GitHub defines and picks your most popular repos and puts those at the top. You have no say about what you consider important, or worthwhile, or interesting, or well-engineered, or valuable.

Your Github profile is all the public work you’ve ever done, unordered, unfiltered and unexplained. You may use it to host serious long term projects, a sketch pad for experiments, a backup system, or a place to file bugs. It represents a timeline of your learning as a programmer. This visualization tool is meant to help reflect on what you've worked on thus far and what you've experimented with and learned in your development journeys.

### Problem

A user's Github repos are organized by order of last commit. There is currently no other way to visualize your repos other than as a list. It can be darn near impossible to understand what you've worked on without manually reading your dozens of repos.

### Solution

This app visualizes your repo by language and lets you get a birds eye view simply by logging in with your Github credentials. All data comes from Github's public API.
