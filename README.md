## Github Language Trends

A tool to visualize your use of programming languages on Github.

### Summary

Programming languages come and go, and your Github profile represents a timeline of your learning as a programmer. However, the statistics Github displays are mainly used to help other people understand how useful your profile may be to them: what is shown by default is the projects with the most stars, and the projects youâ€™ve recently pushed to. This app instead is meant to reflect on what you've worked on thus far and what you've experimented with.

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Github's Public API
- Angular.js
- Bootstrap.js
- Chart.js
- Heroku for app hosting
- Postman for API exploring

### Using Github's Public API with Node.js

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is very helpful for exploring APIs. I recommend you give it a try!
- [Repos by user](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories) For users with more than 30 repos, specify per page: `https://api.github.com/users/polinadotio/repos?per_page=100`.
- [Commits by repo](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/): `https://api.github.com/repos/polinadotio/rails-app/commits`.
- Starred Repos: `https://api.github.com/users/polinadotio/starred?page=1&per_page=10000`

```
var https = require('https');

var options = {
  "method": "GET",
  "hostname": "api.github.com",
  "path": "/users/polinadotio/repos?per_page=100",
  "headers": {
    "User-Agent": "polinadotio"
  }
};

var repo_data;

var req = https.request(options, function (res) {
  var chunks = [];

  res.on("data", function (chunk) {
    chunks.push(chunk);
  });

  res.on("end", function () {
    var body = Buffer.concat(chunks);
    repo_data = JSON.parse(body.toString());
    console.log("response", repo_data);
    if (callback) {
      callback(result);
    }
  });
});

req.end();
```

### Getting started

- `git clone https://github.com/polinadotio/git-stats.git`
- `npm install && bower install`
- Start server at `app.js`

#### Obstacles to overcome

- Rate limited by Github, had to wait some time.
- This ended up steering me away from using the API as much as I had liked.
- So intead of focusing on different ways I could use the API, I used only 1 API call and tried to see how I could make use of that one call.
