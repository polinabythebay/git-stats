## Github Language Trends

Visualize your public repositories with D3.js!

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Github's Public API
- Angular.js
- Heroku for app hosting
- Postman for API exploring

### Getting started

- `git clone https://github.com/polinadotio/git-stats.git`
- 'npm install && bower install'

#### Obstacles to overcome

- Rate limited by Github, had to wait some time.
- This ended up steering me away from using the API as much as I had liked.
- So intead of focusing on different ways I could use the API, I used only 1 API call and tried to see how I could make use of that one call.
